        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: December 26, 2024</p>

        <h2>Agreement</h2>
        <p>By using FileFlow, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the app.</p>

        <h2>What FileFlow Does</h2>
        <p>FileFlow is a file organization tool that helps you categorize and move files on your Mac. It uses AI to suggest where files should go, but <strong>you always have final control</strong> over any file operations.</p>

        <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Backups:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining backups of your files. While FileFlow is designed to be safe and reversible, we recommend regular backups.</li>
            <li><strong>API Keys:</strong> If you use AI features, you are responsible for your API key and any associated costs from your AI provider.</li>
            <li><strong>File Decisions:</strong> You are responsible for reviewing and approving file operations before committing them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)</h2>
        <p>FileFlow uses a BYOK model for AI features. This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You provide and pay for your own API key</li>
            <li>You have a direct relationship with your AI provider</li>
            <li>FileFlow does not charge for AI usage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>FileFlow is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for any data loss, though we've designed the app with safety as a priority (Copy → Verify → Discard workflow, full Undo support).</p>

        <h2>Pro Purchase</h2>
        <p>FileFlow Pro is a one-time purchase. Refunds are handled through Apple according to their App Store policies.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms. Continued use of FileFlow after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
